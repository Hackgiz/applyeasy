## What’s new
- 🌗 **Light/Dark theme toggle** in the popup (persists across sessions).
- 🧯 **Popup stability fix**: no more dead buttons if storage is empty.
- 🎨 Refreshed popup UI: cleaner layout, better spacing & buttons.
- 🪟 Themed in-page toasts that match your popup theme.

## Still included (from recent versions)
- ✅ Adapters: **Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, iCIMS, Taleo**
- 📎 **Upload helpers**: highlight resume/cover inputs and open the file chooser
- ⌨️ Shortcut: **Alt+Shift+A** to autofill current page

## Install (unpacked)
1. Download `applyeasy-ready-v0.3.8.zip` from this release.
2. Unzip → open `chrome://extensions` → enable **Developer Mode** → **Load unpacked** → select the `applyeasy-ready-v0.3.8` folder.

## Notes
- Browsers block programmatic file uploads; the helper scrolls, outlines, and opens the chooser—then you pick the file.
- Workday portals vary a lot; this build targets common external forms. Report tricky pages with a screenshot + URL pattern.

## Known/Next
- Add **SAP SuccessFactors** + **BrassRing** adapters.
- Workday fine-tuning for specific employers (send examples!).
