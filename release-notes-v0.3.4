🚀 What’s new
Bundled parsers (no setup): pdf.js + pdf.worker and mammoth.browser included locally — just load the extension and go.

Upload once → Fill anywhere: Upload a PDF or DOCX resume in the popup, save, then click Update my information & Fill.

Floating on-page button: A small “Update my information” bubble appears on application pages for one-click fill.

ATS coverage: Tuned heuristics for Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, plus many generic forms.

Best-effort file attach: Tries to attach your resume to file inputs via drag-and-drop (falls back to manual if the site blocks it).

Local-only privacy: All data stays in browser local storage. No network calls, no trackers.

🛠 How it works
Open the extension → Upload resume (PDF/DOCX).

Review the extracted fields and Save.

On a job application page, click the floating button or use the popup’s Update my information & Fill.

You’ll see a toast like “ApplyEasy filled 18 field(s)”.

📦 Install / Update (Chrome)
Download the ZIP from this release and unzip it.

Go to chrome://extensions → enable Developer mode.

Click Load unpacked → select the unzipped folder.

(Optional) Pin the extension to your toolbar.

⚠ Notes / Limitations
Some sites block programmatic file selection. Text fields will fill; you may still need to click the file picker to attach the resume file.

If a form loads inside an iframe or SPA stepper, wait a second after opening the form before clicking Fill.

🔧 Known issues
Very unusual label text or custom widgets may need a second click or minor manual edits.
