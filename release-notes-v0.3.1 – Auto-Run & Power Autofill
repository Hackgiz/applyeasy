What’s new (v0.3.1)
“Update my information” button in the popup.
Click it on any job site and the extension:

pulls data from your default stored resume (PDF/DOCX),

updates your saved ApplyEasy profile, then

fills the page.

Default resume picker (Options → Default Resume).
Choose which uploaded resume powers the update.

Resume parsing on upload.
When you add a resume in Options, the extension parses it and caches a profile (name, email, phone, city/state/ZIP, headline, LinkedIn).

PDF parsing uses pdf.js (already wired).

DOCX parsing is supported if you drop mammoth.browser.min.js into lib/ (optional). If you don’t want to add it, just upload a PDF.
